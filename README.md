## Overview

HTML file links to CSS Stylesheet while JavaScript provides the user prompts, confirmation and generation of a password that meets the criteria of the user inputs.  User is presented with a prompt message to choose a password length that is 8 to 128 characters.  If the user inputs a value outside those parameters, they are prompted with a message reminding of the parameters.  Once the user inputs a whole number between 8 and 128, they see an alert that confirms their choice and their input is logged in the console as a number. 

Then the user interacts with a series of prompts to choose yes or no as to whether or not they want to include numeric characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or special characters.  Each user input is confirmed with an alert confirming their choice and a boolean value is logged in the console.
